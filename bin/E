# Use emacs (preferrably in --daemon mode) as a pager on steroids!

# Changelog:
# 12/04/2018  - E now handles ansi colored output!
#             - E also now creates a *scratch* buffer and inserts the output
#               into it, which is better than opening a tmpfile,  because you
#               can kill it without emacs  annoying you with a
#               file-modified-really-kill?-prompt.
#             - E now re-uses your current emacs window when used as a
#               non-pager, i.e. simple called with 'E' instead of 'cmd|E'. This
#               is especially neat when you're using calling it from a terminal
#               inside emacs!
#             - E can now accepts a file name arg when used as non-pager!

# Example usage:
#       E
#       E file.txt
#       man flock | E
#       systemd-nspawn --help|E
#       cat /proc/cpuinfo|E
#       nmap -p22 192.168.20.1/24 --open | E
#       ls --color=always | E
# ...etc.
